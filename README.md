# Deployment
Take a look at the live site [here](https://chronicles-of-pride-9a12d37ba4db.herokuapp.com/).

## ElephantSQL Database

The project uses [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) for the PostgreSQL Database.

To obtain your own Postgres Database, sign-up with your GitHub account, then follow these steps:

- Click **Create New Instance** to start a new database and choose a name.
- Select the **(Free)** plan, **Region** and **Data Center** closest to you.
- Once created, click on the new database name, where you can view the database URL and Password.

## Cloudinary API

The project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.

- For *Primary interest*, you can choose *Programmable Media for image and video API*.
- Optional: *edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable*.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.

## Heroku

### Create a Heroku App:

- Log into your [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) account or create an account.
- On the main page click the **New** button at the top right corner and select **Create New App** from the dropdown menu. 
![Heroku Create App](/documentation/readme_images/heroku-create-new.png)
- Enter in a unique app name.
- Select your region.
- Click **Create App**.
![Heroku New App](/documentation/readme_images/heroku-create-app.png)

### Prepare the environment and settings.py file:
- In your workspace, create an `env.py` file in the main directory. 
- You should add following to the file:

```python
import os

os.environ['CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME'] = '<your-cloudinary-cloud-name>'
os.environ['CLOUDINARY_API_KEY'] = '<your-cloudinary-api-key>'
os.environ['CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET'] = '<your-cloudinary-api-secret>'
os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = '<your-secret-key>'
os.environ['ALLOWED_HOST'] = '<your-localhost-address>'
os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = "<your-elephantsql-database-url-or-alternative>"
```

- Make sure the `settings.py` file has `env.py` imported.
- Comment out the default database configuration.
- Save all files and make migrations.
- Add the Cloudinary libraries to the list of installed apps.
- Add the STATIC files settings - the url, storage path, directory path, root path, media url and default file storage path.
- Link the file to the templates directory in Heroku.
- Change the templates directory to `TEMPLATES_DIR`.
- Add Heroku to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list the format ['app_name.heroku.com', 'localhost']

### Create files & directories
- Create a `requirements.txt` file using command:
```python
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```
or
```python
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
- Create directories in the main directory, eg: static, templates.
- Create a **Procfile** in the main directory and add the following: web: gunicorn project_name.wsgi
- Make sure the Procfile is capitalized and only has one line.

### Update Heroku Config Vars
Add the following Config Vars in Heroku:
- SECRET_KEY: value
- DATABASE_URL: value
- CLOUDINARY_URL: value

### Deploy
- Make sure `DEBUG = False` in `settings.py`
- Go to the deploy tab on Heroku and connect to GitHub, then to the required repository. 
- Scroll to the bottom of the deploy page and either click Enable Automatic Deploys for automatic deploys or Deploy Branch to deploy manually. Manually deployed branches will need to be re-deployed each time the GitHub repository is updated.
- Click **Open App** to view the deployed site live.

# Submission

## Introduction

Prideful Pixels unveils Chronicals of Pride, a walk through history of the LGBTQIA+ movement and a platform to bring people from the community as well as those outside it together. Chronicals of Pride is primarily educational platform that showcases more than a century of the important milestones for the LGBTQIA+ community.<br>
<br>
The interactive timeline provides a journey through the community's history enabling visitors to follow the development of the movement from the past decades to today. Users can access the blog section to share personal stories, support and comments, while the flashcards can answer pertinent questions inquiring minds might have. Site visitors can contact Prideful Pixels and share their own story or questions by submitting a contact form, anonymously if they so choose, to the admin team. At the same time, we make the latest global news regarding the community easily available.

## Goal

The main objective of Chronicals of Pride is to create a safe and supporting space for users in the LGBTQIA+ community. For those outside of it, we've created an interactive learning experience focused on the general history, important events and people of the movement. The Prideful Pixels team strived to provide a concise understanding of this month's hackathon theme by addressing the following aspects:
<br>
<details>
<summary>‚û°Ô∏è Problem Statement</summary>
Being misunderstood can be one of the main challenges for individuals in the LGBTQIA+ community and for the community as a whole. At times, this can be a product of misinformation or lack thereof. Our goal as the Prideful Pixels team was to bridge this knowledge gap and foster interaction among people within and outside of the LGBTQIA+ community.
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>‚û°Ô∏è Objectives</summary>
  <ul>
  <li>Responsiveness (easy accessibility on desktop and mobile devices)</li>
  <li>Provide relevant information and resources</li>
  <li>Ensure an interactive, fun environment</li>
  <li>Enable visitors to interact</li>
  </ul>
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>‚û°Ô∏è Target Audience</summary>
On one hand, Chronicles of Pride was designed to target a 'cold audience' who might not have much knowledge of LGBTQIA+ history but who are open to learning. Similarly, the site provides a platform for people in the LGBTQIA+ community to share their experiences and help educate others. Our target audience is a questioning teenager as much as a flamboyant retiree, a couple, a shut-in, person in Sweden wishing to share their story, a man in Central Europe who narrowly escaped an attack for being himself just days ago, a person not yet ready to label themselves, a lion, scarecrow and, finally, a tinman. 
</details>
<br>

<details>
<summary>‚û°Ô∏è Benefits</summary>
Chronicles of Pride shares an easy, accessable way to learn about the history of the LGBTQIA+ community, as well as fun facts about flags and noted trailblazers. Users can interact with people in their community in a low-key atmosphere, thus helping break any boundaries that may exist.
